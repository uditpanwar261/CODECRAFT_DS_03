# CODECRAFT_DS_03
Built a Decision Tree Classifier using the Bank Marketing dataset to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. Performed data preprocessing, model training, and visualized the decision tree for interpretability.

ðŸ§  Bank Marketing Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier
This project builds a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and behavioral data. The model uses the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Source: UCI Bank Marketing Dataset

Contains information on:

Age, job, marital status, education, etc.

Contact and communication details

Target variable: y â€” whether the client subscribed (yes/no)

ðŸ”§Features Used 
age, job, marital, education, default, balance, housing, loan, contact, day, month, duration, campaign, pdays, previous, poutcome

âœ… Tasks Performed
âœ… Data loading and preprocessing (dropna, encoding categorical variables)

âœ… Model training using DecisionTreeClassifier

âœ… Visualization of the decision tree using plot_tree()

âœ… Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

ðŸ“Š Output
Decision Tree is plotted with labeled nodes showing splits based on key features.

duration is often the most informative feature.

You can view and interpret the tree structure to understand how decisions are made.
